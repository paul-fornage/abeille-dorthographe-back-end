## EXTREMELY EARLY DEVELOPMENT!!!!

Because I share the same readme in a couple places, I'm just gonna link it so there's only one version to maintain.

## Licences

Anything I write is MIT license, I'm not toally certain on the excact terms, but you can do whatever you want with it, with no terms etc, but can't sue me for the code being bad in any way...

HOWEVER, the word lists are not mine and are copyrighted under `CC-by-sa-4.0`. I got them from [here](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) and it probably took countless hours to compile all that, so please respect the licence.
